# VisualCompass
This is a simple visual compass for use in robotics projects. The idea is to make the robot look at the ceiling to determine its orientation. First a few images of the ceiling must be captured, all with the north facing upwards. The algorithm will detect and record SIFT features of these images. Later, when the robot needs to check its orientation, it samples a new image of the ceiling. The algorithm then detects the SIFT features of the sampled image and tries to match with every set of SIFT features detected from the reference images. Then it finds the best match and returns the angle in radians
